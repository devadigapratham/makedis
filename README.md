## **Why Makedis?**

Makedis stands out as a complete deployment and proxying solution, offering:  

1. **Seamless Deployment Workflow**  
   - Automatically handles code cloning, building, and deployment to Amazon S3, minimizing manual overhead.  

2. **Reverse Proxy for Static Assets**  
   - Efficiently maps subdomains and domains to static assets stored in S3, ensuring fast and reliable content delivery.  

3. **Scalability at its Core**  
   - Built using Docker and AWS, Makedis can handle dynamic traffic, large-scale projects, and complex application requirements.  

4. **Modular Design for Flexibility**  
   - Each service is designed as an independent module, making it easy to customize and extend functionality.  

5. **Developer-Friendly Setup**  
   - Clear setup instructions and minimal configuration requirements allow developers to focus on building rather than infrastructure.

## **Project Overview**

Makedis consists of the following services:  

### **1. API Server**  
The heart of the application, responsible for handling HTTP requests and orchestrating tasks like triggering builds and deployments.  

### **2. Build Server**  
A service dedicated to:  
- Cloning repositories.  
- Building Docker images.  
- Pushing static builds to Amazon S3 buckets.  

### **3. S3 Reverse Proxy**  
A reverse proxy service that:  
- Routes requests to appropriate S3 buckets.  
- Ensures seamless mapping of subdomains and domains to static assets.

## **How to Set Up Makedis Locally**

Follow these steps to get Makedis running locally:

### **1. Install Dependencies**  
In each service folder (`api-server`, `build-server`, `s3-reverse-proxy`), run:  
```bash
npm install
```

### **2. Build and Push Docker Image for Build Server**  
To build the `build-server` Docker image and push it to AWS ECR:  
```bash
docker build -t makedis-build-server .
docker tag makedis-build-server <aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/makedis-build-server
docker push <aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/makedis-build-server
```

### **3. Configure the API Server**  
Provide the necessary configuration details such as:  
- **TASK ARN**: The AWS task definition ARN.  
- **CLUSTER ARN**: The AWS ECS cluster ARN.  

### **4. Start Services**  
Run the following commands in their respective directories:  
```bash
# Start the API Server
cd api-server
node index.js

# Start the S3 Reverse Proxy
cd s3-reverse-proxy
node index.js
```
